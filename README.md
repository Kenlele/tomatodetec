#tomato detection system with linebot
Tomato Disease Detection Project

Overview

This project aims to detect and classify tomato plant diseases using machine learning models. By analyzing images of tomato plants, the model can identify various diseases and provide accurate predictions to help farmers manage crop health. The project integrates Keras, TensorFlow, and Flask for real-time prediction, making it accessible via a simple web interface.

Key Features

	•	Image Classification: Detects different types of tomato diseases.
	•	Pre-trained Model: Fine-tuned using a dataset of 60,000 images from Kaggle.
	•	Real-time Analysis: Users can upload images and receive disease detection results via a web interface.
	•	Line Bot Integration: The project is connected with a LINE bot for easy access.

Tech Stack

	•	Python 3.x
	•	TensorFlow & Keras
	•	Flask (Backend API)
	•	OpenCV (Image Processing)
	•	LINE Messaging API
	•	Azure Deployment
